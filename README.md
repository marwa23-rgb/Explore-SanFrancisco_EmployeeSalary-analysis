# Explore SanFrancisco_EmployeeSalary-analysis
Explore_SanFrancisco_Employee_Salary analysis is a data analysis project that explores the San Francisco City Salary dataset, a public dataset that contains salary and benefits data for San Francisco city employees. The goal of the project is to gain insights into the factors that influence salary, identify patterns, and make recommendations for improving salary equity.
The project begins with an initial data exploration to understand the structure and contents of the dataset. This is done using commands like head(), info(), and describe() in Python. Once the dataset is understood, the project checks for any missing values or duplicates. Any missing values are handled and duplicate rows are removed.
